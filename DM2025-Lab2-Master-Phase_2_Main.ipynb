       "Of course! Here is a comprehensive explanation of Data Exploration.\n",
       "\n",
       "### A Simple Analogy\n",
       "\n",
       "Imagine you're a detective arriving at a crime scene. Before you can solve the case, you first need to understand what you're dealing with. You don't just jump to conclusions. Instead, you:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Survey the scene:** How big is it? What's the layout?\n",
       "*   **Look for clues:** You examine objects, look for fingerprints, and note anything unusual.\n",
       "*   **Take notes and photos:** You document everything you see.\n",
       "*   **Form initial theories:** \"Maybe the entry was through this window,\" or \"This object seems out of place.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "**Data Exploration is the detective work of data analysis.** It's the first and most critical step you take when you get a new dataset. You're not trying to build a final model or find a definitive answer yet; you're just trying to understand the \"scene\" of your data.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### What is Data Exploration?\n",
       "\n",
       "**Data Exploration**, also known as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), is the process of investigating datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods.\n",
       "\n",
       "The primary goal is to get familiar with the data, understand its structure, identify patterns, spot anomalies (like outliers or errors), and formulate hypotheses that can be tested later. It's a philosophy of letting the data speak for itself before you impose your own assumptions on it.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Why is Data Exploration So Important?\n",
       "\n",
       "Without proper exploration, you risk making flawed assumptions, which can lead to inaccurate models and incorrect conclusions. This is the classic \"garbage in, garbage out\" problem.\n",
       "\n",
       "The key goals of data exploration are:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Understand the Data's Structure:** How many rows and columns are there? What are the data types of each column (e.g., number, text, date)?\n",
       "2.  **Clean the Data:** Identify missing values, duplicates, or obvious errors that need to be handled before analysis.\n",
       "3.  **Identify Key Variables:** Determine which variables are the most important or might have the most influence on your outcome.\n",
       "4.  **Uncover Patterns and Relationships:** Discover initial trends, correlations, or connections between variables. For example, \"Do customers who buy product A also tend to buy product B?\"\n",
       "5.  **Spot Anomalies and Outliers:** Find unusual data points that don't fit the general pattern. These could be errors or genuinely interesting findings.\n",
       "6.  **Formulate Hypotheses:** Based on what you find, you can develop educated guesses that you can then test with more formal statistical methods. (\"I hypothesize that sales are higher on weekends.\")\n",
       "7.  **Inform Feature Engineering:** Understanding your variables helps you create new, more meaningful features for machine learning models.\n",
       "\n",
       "### The Process: Key Steps in Data Exploration\n",
       "\n",
       "While the process is iterative and creative, it generally follows these steps:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **First Look (The \"Head and Tail\"):**\n",
       "    *   View the first few and last few rows of the data to get a feel for the columns and the kind of data they contain.\n",
       "    *   Check the dimensions of the dataset (number of rows and columns).\n",
       "    *   Get a list of column names and their data types.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Univariate Analysis (Analyzing One Variable at a Time):**\n",
       "    *   **For Numerical Variables:** Calculate descriptive statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, min, and max. Visualize the distribution using **histograms** or **box plots**.\n",
       "    *   **For Categorical Variables:** Calculate frequency counts of each category. Visualize this with **bar charts**.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Bivariate Analysis (Analyzing Two Variables Together):**\n",
       "    *   This is where you start looking for relationships.\n",
       "    *   **Numerical vs. Numerical:** Use a **scatter plot** to see if there's a correlation (e.g., does height increase with weight?).\n",
       "    *   **Categorical vs. Numerical:** Use a **box plot** or **violin plot** to compare the distribution of a numerical variable across different categories (e.g., comparing average salaries across different departments).\n",
       "    *   **Categorical vs. Categorical:** Use a **contingency table** (crosstab) or a **stacked bar chart**.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Multivariate Analysis (Analyzing Three or More Variables):**\n",
       "    *   This involves looking at more complex interactions.\n",
       "    *   Use techniques like **heatmaps** to visualize correlations between many variables at once.\n",
       "    *   Use color, size, or shape in scatter plots to introduce a third or fourth variable.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Handling Missing Data and Outliers:**\n",
       "    *   During your analysis, you'll identify missing values and outliers. You'll need to decide on a strategy for dealing with them (e.g., remove them, fill them in with a mean/median, or investigate them further).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Common Tools for Data Exploration\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Programming Languages:**\n",
       "    *   **Python:** The most popular choice, with powerful libraries like **Pandas** (for data manipulation), **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** (for static visualizations), and **Plotly** (for interactive charts).\n",
       "    *   **R:** A language built for statistics, with excellent packages like **dplyr** (for data manipulation) and **ggplot2** (for high-quality visualizations).\n",
       "*   **Business Intelligence (BI) Tools:**\n",
       "    *   **Tableau**, **Power BI**, and **Qlik** allow for drag-and-drop exploration and the creation of interactive dashboards.\n",
       "*   **Spreadsheet Software:**\n",
       "    *   **Microsoft Excel** or **Google Sheets** are great for smaller datasets and quick, basic exploration.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Summary\n",
       "\n",
       "In short, **Data Exploration is the foundational step of any data-driven project.** It's a creative and investigative process that transforms raw, messy data into a clean, understood dataset, revealing initial insights and guiding the entire direction of your analysis and modeling efforts. It's about asking questions of your data and letting the data answer back."

    "By default, an LLM responds with unstructured, free-form text. For data mining, this is often impractical, as we need data in a predictable format to load into tools like a pandas DataFrame for analysis. **Structured output** is a powerful feature that forces the model to return its response in a specific, machine-readable format, such as JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to enabling this is to provide the model with a **response schema**. This schema acts as a strict template or blueprint that the model's output must conform to. Instead of generating a paragraph, the model will fill in the fields defined in your schema with the relevant information it extracts from the prompt.\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "LLM embeddings are dense numerical vectors that represent the semantic meaning of text. Generated by Large Language Models, they map words, phrases, or documents into a high-dimensional space where similar concepts are positioned closely together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their key advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Contextual Understanding:** Unlike older methods, LLM embeddings are contextual. The vector for a word like **\"bank\"** will be different depending on whether it's used in the context of a \"river bank\" or a \"money bank,\" providing a more nuanced representation of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Versatility from Pre-training:** They are pre-trained on vast amounts of text data. This allows them to generalize effectively across various tasks, such as classification, clustering, and similarity detection. They do not require extensive retraining.\n",

Texts can contain mixed feelings (e.g., \"bittersweet\") or use similar language to express different emotions, causing their embeddings to be naturally close in semantic space. And also the process of projecting high-dimensional embeddings down to a 2D visualization inevitably loses some information, which can make distinct clusters appear to overlap."

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
